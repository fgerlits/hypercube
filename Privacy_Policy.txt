Privacy Policy for Hypercube Viewer

Hypercube Viewer respects your privacy, and does not collect any personal information whatsoever.

It does not create any log files, and does not record your activity at all.  Note, however, that depending on your settings, Google may record and store events such as when you install or uninstall apps, when apps crash etc.

Hypercube Viewer does not contain any advertisements, and does not share any information with any companies, other than Google as mentioned above.

Children under the age of 13 are unlikely to find Hypercube Viewer interesting, but if they do, the app does not let them share any of their personal information with anyone, either.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the developers at hypercube.viewer.app@gmail.com.
